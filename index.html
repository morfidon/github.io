                The course was a great match! As a novice in programming, I enjoyed
ił and found ił easier to uderstand. To be more specific, the
theoretical aspects followed by practical examples, made this lesson
to permeate into my memory and made me uderstand much more
easier.

                Arkadiusz have good teaching skills. He's focused on the important parts and have a great tips. I
                watched some other tutorials but non had this level of explaining to the details of core of the JS
                language. Keep up the good work!

                The courses is well structured starting from basic to advanced. The
                course gets bełter and bełter, much interesting once you move
                forward. Last few topics has good helping tips for the developer. The
                course author is very helpful and respond to the queries
                instantaneously.

                I guess is the only course ľve completed from Udemy :).
The teacher is not good, is extremely good.
After you've completed the training, you don't become an expert in
c++, you become a Guru in c++.
You will learn all the fundamentals in computer programming, you
will play with pointers and references like your second nature, you
will understand finally What the streams are, you will understand
why you do a certain thing, why you do ił and when you do ił.
All the lessons are built on each othert I really advise people to stop
the video, try your solution and play ił again.
If you really feel, you want to dedicate a month or two, or even more,
and I talk from my experience, after you've done with this course,
you can learn any other programming language on the market, in no
more than 2 hours, and thaťs because, all the other programming
languages that exist, have at their core, the C++ knowledge.
Once you know the basis, you can jump on any framework, unreal
engine, unity, react, angular, you name them, and truły understand
them without opening any book.
The only challenge that we can face in order to build anything, will be
our own practice. And when i say practice, i say: "You google What
you want to do, find the library and the functions, and implement
that, in no time”
This couse is like a diamond, in a vast pool of information, and
whoever found ił, probably, he was a seeker like me.
Thanks again for this amazing teaching, and i wish you many
blessings ^^

                The instructor shows sincere interest in students in Q&A section.
The exercises added to each lecture made this course whole. They
allowed me to strengthen the newly gained knowledge.
To sum up using the course I learnt rapidly C++ fundamentals.
I recommend C++ from beginner to expert 100%.
